# GraphQL VS REST

REST:

- Multiple endpoints
- Both Typically JSON Data
- Both Stateless
- Each request has a: Verb, a Path, and a body (optional)

GRAPHQL:

- Invented by Facebook
- One endpoint made with a post request
- Both Typically JSON Data
- Both Stateless
- Each request is a POST to a single path (usually /graphql) and a graphql query in your request body
